### My name is Kintaro Oe.
I'm 25 years old.
I'm an easy-going, job-hopping part-timer.

Tokyo University Dept. of Law dropout.
He withdrew from school because he had mastered the entire curriculum.
Since then he has been changing jjobs numerous times, learning about life.
Riding his favorite bike, Crescent Moon, he keeps on moving.
And perhaps someday, he may save Japan, or even the world...
